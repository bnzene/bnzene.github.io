<b>I'm Eleanor Kavanagh-Brown, developer and electronic musician, and I go by the Github username <a href="https://github.com/bnzene"><em>bnzene</em></a>.</b>
 <p>I'm a recent graduate of Makers Academy in London, and my area of interest is the intersection of music and technology.<p>
 <p>In October 2016 I finished a Masters in Sonic Arts at Goldsmiths University. This is where I originally got into programming, through making music and art tools with <a href="https://puredata.info">Pure Data</a>. Some of these tools can be seen <a href="/pd_projects">here</a>.</p>
 <p>I'm also an electronic (and analogue) musician and produce weird music, which can be found <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bnzene"><em>here</em></a>.</p>
